Welcome to SPGA - Simple and Personalizable Genetic Algorithm
=============================================================

SPGA (Simple and Personalizable Genetic Algorithm) is a minimalist Python library for evolutionary computation that focuses on:

- **Customization First**: Provides full control over solution encoding, selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation while handling the genetic algorithm structure automatically
- **Generational Approach**: Implements a standard generational genetic algorithm with elitism and early stopping capabilities
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Designed to let you focus on your problem-specific components rather than algorithm implementation details

Key Features:
- Easy-to-use interface for rapid prototyping
- Pre-built genetic operators with customization options
- Flexible solution representation (any Python object)
- Built-in progress visualization
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies
